### Tiny Tapeout Module

currently the tiny tapeout user module has two modes: either pure combinational
to compute the (state, symbol) -> (state, symbol, direction) transition
function, or sequential where internal memory elements hold the current state
which advances when a tape interface gives the core a new symbol to process.
